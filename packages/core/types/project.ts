/**
 * How tasks sharing one local directory are executed.
 *
 * - `in_place`: the agent works directly in the user's directory and tasks run
 *   one at a time — a second task waits in `waiting_local_directory`. Edits
 *   land in the user's working copy.
 * - `worktree`: each task gets its own git worktree of that repo inside the
 *   runtime's workspace, so tasks run concurrently and deliver their work as a
 *   branch instead of touching the working copy. Every task of one conversation
 *   shares that branch — `agent/<agent>/<issue>` — so a follow-up continues the
 *   previous turn's work; a task with no conversation behind it gets
 *   `agent/<agent>/<task>`. Continuation is decided by an ownership record in
 *   the repo, not by the branch name, so a same-named branch the user made is
 *   never adopted.
 *
 * Absent means `in_place`: resources created before the mode existed keep their
 * original behavior, so this is optional rather than defaulted on the server.
