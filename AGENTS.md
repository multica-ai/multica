# Repository Guidelines

This file provides guidance to AI agents when working with code in this repository.

## Quick Reference

### Architecture

Go backend + monorepo frontend (pnpm workspaces + Turborepo) with shared packages.

- `server/` — Go backend (Chi router, sqlc, gorilla/websocket)
- `apps/web/` — Next.js frontend (App Router)
- `apps/desktop/` — Electron desktop app
- `packages/core/` — Headless business logic (Zustand stores, React Query hooks, API client)
- `packages/ui/` — Atomic UI components (shadcn/Base UI, zero business logic)
- `packages/views/` — Shared business pages/components
- `packages/tsconfig/` — Shared TypeScript config

### State Management (critical)

- **React Query** owns all server state (issues, members, agents, inbox, workspace list)
- **Zustand** owns all client state (current workspace selection, view filters, drafts, modals)
- All Zustand stores live in `packages/core/` — never in `packages/views/` or app directories
- WS events invalidate React Query — never write directly to stores

### Package Boundaries (hard rules)

- `packages/core/` — zero react-dom, zero localStorage, zero process.env
- `packages/ui/` — zero `@multica/core` imports
- `packages/views/` — zero `next/*`, zero `react-router-dom`, use `NavigationAdapter` for routing
- `apps/web/platform/` — only place for Next.js APIs

### Commands

```bash
make dev              # Auto-setup + start everything
pnpm typecheck        # TypeScript check
pnpm test             # TS unit tests (Vitest)
make test             # Go tests
make check            # Full verification pipeline
```

See CLAUDE.md for the complete command reference.

### Permission Model (critical — fork divergence)

Our fork enforces **stricter** agent permissions than upstream:

- **Agent edit/archive/restore** → owner only (no Admin bypass)
- **Agent ENV values** → owner only (keys visible to all, values masked)
- **Agent visibility** → all workspace members can read any agent's config
- **Agent duplication** → any member can copy any agent (copy owned by them)
- **Private agent trigger** → owner only

⚠️ When merging upstream code, never re-introduce `isAdminLike` bypass in `canEditAgent` or `canViewAgentEnv`.
