-- snap the cutoff back to UTC midnight, dragging in an extra partial
-- local day for any non-UTC viewer.
-- provider is LOWER()-normalized so mixed-case historical rows (written
-- before the handler lowercased provider on write) merge with new rows
-- instead of forming a separate case-variant bucket.

-- by agent for the "by agent" list on the dashboard.
--
-- task_count is summed across hourly buckets — one task that spans
-- multiple hours lands in multiple buckets, so this over-counts by
-- hour the same way the daily version over-counted by day. The
-- frontend prefers `ListDashboardAgentRunTime` for the user-facing
-- "tasks" column, so this stays informational only.
