// Streaming attachment upload.
//
// Attachments used to travel as one multipart body through the API. That puts
// every byte through whatever reverse proxy fronts the deployment, so a proxy's
// request-body limit rejects large files outright and a slow link keeps a
// request open for the whole transfer. The direct path inverts both: the file
// is PUT straight to object storage with an explicit Content-Length, and only
// metadata reaches the API.
//
// The file is streamed, never buffered. A caller that hands in a path passes it
// through LocalUploadSource, which reopens the file per attempt and reports its
// size up front, so a 100 MiB upload costs the CLI one file descriptor and a
// copy buffer rather than 100 MiB of heap — and three of them cost the same.
//
// Compatibility is the other half of the contract. A server that predates the
// endpoint answers 404/405, and one whose storage backend cannot presign
// answers 501 with a stable code; both fall back to the multipart path. Every
// other failure (401, 403, a rejected PUT, a 5xx) is reported instead of being
// retried through the old path, because the upload may already have consumed
// the user's bytes and a blind retry would either duplicate the object or
// double the transfer.

// directUploadCapabilityUnsupportedCode is the machine-readable code a server
// returns when its storage backend cannot serve presigned uploads. It is the
// only 501 the client treats as "fall back"; a 501 with any other body is a
// server bug and is reported.
