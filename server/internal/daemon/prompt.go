Strip filler words but preserve key semantic information.\n\n")

Squads are first-class assignees too — a squad name (e.g. \"Super Human\") routes work to the squad leader, who then delegates. On a clean unambiguous match, prefer `--assignee-id <uuid>` using the `user_id` (member) or `id` (agent or squad) from that JSON — UUID matching is exact and robust to name collisions in workspaces with overlapping names. `--assignee <name>` (fuzzy) is acceptable as a fallback when names are unambiguous. On no match or ambiguous match, do NOT pass either flag — instead append a final line to the description: `Unrecognized assignee: X`.\n")
