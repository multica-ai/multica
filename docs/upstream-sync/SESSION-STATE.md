# Session State

**Format:** This file is the single source of truth for autonomous-loop execution. It is read at the start of every iteration and written at the end. Never edit during a running iteration.

## Current state

```yaml
status: RUNNING              # NOT_STARTED | RUNNING | PAUSED | COMPLETED | HALTED
current_phase: "Phase 1"     # which phase we're in
current_task: "1a_rename"    # chunk 4 — rename 7 isolated packages
last_iteration_at: "2026-05-05T21:30:00Z"
total_iterations: 3
total_tokens_estimate: 1450000
```

## Pause reason (if status = PAUSED)

```yaml
paused_at: null
pause_reason: null           # "phase_boundary" | "eval_failure_3x" | "user_review_required" | "irreversible_action"
awaiting: null               # what user input is needed
```

## Decision log

```
# Format: ISO_TIMESTAMP | PHASE | DECISION | RATIONALE
2026-05-05T20:50:00Z | Phase -1 | HOLD | 5 PASS, 2 HOLD with mitigations, 1 NO-GO (P7) handled by existing escalation rule. Strategy sound; plan amendments required before Phase 0.
2026-05-05T20:50:00Z | Phase -1 | proceed_to_phase_0 | Per autonomous protocol: 7 of 8 effective passes → HOLD → proceed with caveat documented in preflight/SUMMARY.md
2026-05-05T21:11:00Z | Phase 0a | chunk_2_GO | All eval checks PASS (typecheck, vitest, Go tests, cerebro-patches script). 12 cerebro-* package skeletons + server/internal/cerebro/* + scripts/validate-cerebro-patches.sh + scripts/upstream-sync.sh skeleton + CI guard job landed. Bash 3.2 compat fix to per-session-eval.sh.
2026-05-05T21:11:00Z | Phase 0a | proceed_to_chunk_3 | Foundation skeleton complete; chunk 3 now adds feature flags + multi-dir migrate + 9NNN move + CLAUDE.md.
2026-05-05T21:30:00Z | Phase 0b | chunk_3_GO | Feature flag system end-to-end (frontend Zustand + persist + TanStack Query, backend Go handler + sqlc + migration + WS event), CLAUDE.md "Cerebro Extension Discipline" section, eval green after 2 retries (fixed migration idempotency with IF NOT EXISTS, fixed empty-test-set with --passWithNoTests). esbuild arm64 binary required pnpm install --force to refresh.
2026-05-05T21:30:00Z | Phase 0   | foundation_GO | All 7 Phase 0 components complete or deliberately deferred. Phase 1 (L1 extraction) may begin with chunk 4 (rename 7 isolated packages).
```

## Eval results (most recent per phase)

phase_0_chunk_2_evals: PASS  # see eval-reports/chunk-2-20260505T191025Z.md
phase_0_chunk_3_evals: PASS  # see eval-reports/chunk-3-20260505T193016Z.md (3rd attempt)

```

## Stop conditions (autonomous loop must check every iteration)

The loop must STOP and set status=HALTED ONLY when ANY of these triggers (catastrophic only — autonomous mode runs through all phase boundaries):

1. **Phase -1 NO-GO** — 3+ preflight verifications failed; strategy invalidated
2. **3+ consecutive eval failures within current chunk** — after retry attempts exhausted
3. **Total tokens estimate >10M** (well above 5-7M expected; runaway protection)
4. **Iteration count >50** (sanity limit)
5. **Catastrophic risk materialized** — DB corruption, infinite loop in user code, irreversible data loss
6. **Phase 5 merge done** — natural completion; final state ready for user review

**Phase boundaries are NOT pause points.** The loop progresses through Phase -1 → 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 autonomously as long as evals pass. Phase 5 ends with a merged branch ready for user to review and land manually — autonomous loop does NOT push to main or merge to main.

## Next action (autonomous loop reads this to decide what to do)

```yaml
next_action: execute_task     # bootstrap | execute_task | run_phase_eval | pause | halt
next_task_brief: |
  Phase 1a — chunk 4 per 07-session-schedule.md row 4.
  Scope: rename 7 isolated packages from upstream namespace into cerebro namespace. This is mechanical rename work — no new logic.

  Renames (per docs/upstream-sync/01-audit.md and 03-decision.md Phase 1.1):
  1. packages/core/artifacts/      → packages/cerebro-artifacts/core/
  2. packages/views/artifacts/     → packages/cerebro-artifacts/views/
  3. packages/core/attachments/    → packages/cerebro-attachments/core/
  4. packages/views/attachments/   → packages/cerebro-attachments/views/
  5. packages/core/notifications/  → packages/cerebro-notifications/core/
  6. packages/views/notifications/ → packages/cerebro-notifications/views/
  7. packages/views/members/       → packages/cerebro-users/

  IMPORTANT: the cerebro-* destination packages already exist as skeletons (chunk 2). Rename = move source files INTO existing skeleton, then update package.json + index.ts + tsconfig.json to point at the moved code. Delete the old paths.

  Per-package operations:
  - git mv all source files (preserve history)
  - Update destination package.json to declare correct exports + add deps from source
  - Update destination tsconfig.json to include the moved source
  - Update destination index.ts (or index.tsx) to re-export from the moved code
  - grep for old import paths across the entire monorepo (apps/web, apps/desktop, packages/*) and replace with new
  - Verify pnpm-workspace.yaml glob still picks them up (it does — packages/*)

  Strategy (per protocol "7 parallel"):
  Dispatch 4 parallel subagents:
   - SA1: artifacts (core + views into cerebro-artifacts)
   - SA2: attachments (core + views into cerebro-attachments)
   - SA3: notifications (core + views into cerebro-notifications)
   - SA4: members → cerebro-users
  Each handles own subtree end-to-end and reports import paths it updated.

  After all 4 complete, orchestrator:
  - Runs `pnpm install` to refresh workspace links
  - Runs `pnpm typecheck` + `pnpm test` + Go tests (no Go changes expected)
  - Searches for stragglers: `grep -r "@multica/(core|views)/(artifacts|attachments|notifications|members)" apps/ packages/`
  - Runs `scripts/per-session-eval.sh chunk-4`

  Eval gate: same as chunks 2-3. All checks must PASS. Visual regression deferred per P5.
  Branches: stay on chore/upstream-sync-analysis.
  Estimated tokens: ~250-400k (mechanical work; subagents share consistent rename pattern).

  Risk: import path replacements scattered across many files. If subagent misses paths, typecheck catches it. If typecheck fails after retry → reduce scope to one package per iteration.
```
